# EPOP-Benchmark-IREC-2026

**EPOP (Epidemiomonitoring of Plants)** is a benchmark corpus and evaluation framework for **structured information extraction in plant health epidemiology**, prepared for **IREC 2026**.  

The dataset is derived from translated phytosanitary news reports, annotated with **entities**, **coreferences**, and **binary/n-ary relations** (e.g., *Transmits*, *Causes*) with modality and entity linking to **NCBI Taxonomy** and **GeoNames**.  
It serves as a realistic and challenging testbed for **environmental NLP**, **plant protection**, and **knowledge graph enrichment**.
